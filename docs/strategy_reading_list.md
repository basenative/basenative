# Strategic Reading List & Competitive Analysis

This document curates concepts, models, and industry shifts that validate the **Greenput / BaseNative** ecosystem strategy.

## 1. The "Post-Cookie" Ad Economy

_Why "Bannerless" is the future of AdTech._

The industry is moving away from third-party tracking (Cookies) toward **First-Party Data** and **Contextual Intent**.

- **The Thesis**: A user navigating to a specific brand (e.g., "Sparky's Electric") via an ad has high intent. Negotiating consent via a banner kills that momentum.
- **Greenput Solution**: By hosting the _entire_ destination site, we own the first-party context. The user's action (filling the form) _is_ the consent. No third parties involved.
- **Key Concept**: **Zero-Party Data**. Data the customer _intentionally_ shares with a brand.

## 2. Vertical Lead Gen vs. The "Race to the Bottom"

_Disrupting Angi / Thumbtack / HomeAdvisor._

### The Incumbent Problem

Traditional lead gen platforms sell the same lead to 3-5 providers simultaneously.

- **User Exp**: Gets spammed by 5 phone calls in 5 minutes.
- **Pro Exp**: Pays for a lead they might not win. Competes on speed, not quality.
- **Outcome**: Low trust, high churn.

### The Greenput Model (Hosted FSM)

We behave more like **Vertical SaaS** + **Opendoor for Services**.

- **Real-Time Estimate**: We give the user a price _now_.
- **Exclusive Routing**: The lead goes to _one_ pro (the host) first.
- **Risk-Free Redistribution**: If the host declines/fails to convert, the lead enters the **Pool**.
- **Economics**: We monetize the _conversion_ or the _redistribution_, not the mere "click".

## 3. Field Service Management (FSM)

_Pricing "Time" like Airline Seats._

- **Concept**: **Perishable Inventory**. An electrician's empty slot tomorrow morning is worth $0 if not filled.
- **Strategy**: Our FSM engine allows dynamic pricing.
  - _High Demand_: Higher price.
  - _Gap Filling_: Discounted price to fill a schedule hole.
- **BaseNative Role**: The UI must be sophisticated enough to render complex calendars and quotes, which WordPress plugins struggle to do performantly.

## 4. The "Renovation" of SMB Web Hosting

_Why BaseNative?_

- **The Wordpress Trap**: Most SMBs are stuck on slow, insecure, unmaintainable WP sites.
- **The BaseNative Advantage**: A shared, multi-tenant kernel.
  - **Updates**: We push a UI fix, _all_ 10,000 SMB sites get it instantly.
  - **Performance**: Edge-hosted (Cloudflare), blazing fast.
  - **Extensibility**: It's a real web app, not a blog engine.

2.  **"The End of Third-Party Cookies"**: Google's Privacy Sandbox initiatives.
3.  **"Managed Marketplaces"**: How controlling the transaction (the quote) yields higher take rates than just connecting parties (listings).
