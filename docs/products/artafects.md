# Artafects: Business Breakdown

## One-liner

Artafects is a user-owned memory and creative asset system that turns scattered notes, files, and artifacts into a durable, queryable personal or team knowledge base without platform lock-in.

## The problem

People and teams produce valuable artifacts daily: notes, decisions, designs, documents, code snippets, screenshots, and lessons learned. These are fragmented across tools, hard to search, and often lost when platforms change or access is revoked.

## The thesis

Your life and work produce artifacts. If you store them with structure, provenance, and control, you get compounding returns: better decisions, faster creation, and more stable identity over time.

## Target customers

- Creators managing projects and recurring content
- Teams that want durable knowledge without tool sprawl
- Founders and builders who need long-lived context
- Families who want digital legacy and continuity

## Core value proposition

- User-owned storage and retrieval
- Provenance and timeline of artifacts
- Structured metadata that makes search real
- Supports both creative workflow and operational memory
- Designed for long horizon use, not engagement metrics

## Product pillars

1. Artifact capture
   - Ingest from files, notes, chat exports, and web
   - Minimal friction, consistent metadata

2. Provenance and integrity
   - Who created it, when, why
   - Versioning and change history
   - Optional cryptographic receipts for important events

3. Retrieval and synthesis
   - Strong search and filtering
   - Contextual linking and relationships
   - Summary views for projects, decisions, and milestones

4. Ownership and portability
   - Export and migration paths
   - Avoids lock-in by design

## Differentiation

- Artafects is not a social feed and not an engagement machine.
- It is a memory layer that treats truth, provenance, and user control as primary constraints.

## Business model options

- SaaS tiers by storage and retrieval features
- Paid add-ons for advanced ingestion connectors
- Team plans for shared knowledge bases
- Enterprise plans for compliance and retention

## Relationship to Greenput and BaseNative

- Greenput handles consent and rights around data flows.
- Artafects handles artifacts and memory built on top of user-owned principles.
- BaseNative provides the UI and monorepo enforcement for both.

## Success metrics

- Retrieval success rate and time-to-find
- Percentage of artifacts with provenance metadata
- Retention and long-term usage
- Reduced duplicate work and repeated decisions

## Non-goals

- Becoming another content platform
- Tracking users without explicit, understandable consent
- Hiding data behind proprietary formats
