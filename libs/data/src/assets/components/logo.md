### Usage

The `Logo` component renders the BaseNative logo. It is a semantic `figure` element.

```html
<figure logo></figure>
```

### Customization

The logo inherits the current text color (`currentColor`) for its flexible fill.

```css
figure[logo] {
  color: var(--color-primary);
  width: 48px;
}
```
