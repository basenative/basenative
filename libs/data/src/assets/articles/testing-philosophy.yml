### The Pyramid of Confidence

We believe in a balanced testing strategy that optimizes for **Confidence per Minute**.

#### 1. Static Analysis (Real-time)
The first line of defense is not a test, but the compiler.
- **TypeScript Strict Mode**: Eliminates entire classes of null-pointer bugs.
- **ESLint**: Enforces architectural boundaries (e.g., "Feature A cannot import Feature B").
- **Prettier**: Removes all discussions about code formatting.

#### 2. Unit Tests (The Foundation)
We use **Jest** to test individual units logic in isolation.
- **Focus**: Pure functions, Services, and Directive inputs/outputs.
- **Mocking**: External dependencies are mocked to ensure speed.
- **Coverage**: We aim for 100% branch coverage on library logic.

#### 3. Integration Tests (The Glue)
We verify that units play nicely together using `ComponentFixture`.
- **Focus**: Does the `button[variant]` change style when the `ThemeService` emits a signal?
- **Realism**: We use real child components where possible, shallow rendering only when necessary.

#### 4. E2E Tests (The User)
We use **Playwright** component testing for visual and interaction verification.
- **Visual Regression**: comparing screenshots to ensure pixel-perfect rendering of the Glass theme.
- **Interactions**: Clicking real buttons in a real headless browser.
- **Cross-Browser**: Verifying that the Anchor Positioning polyfill works in Safari.
